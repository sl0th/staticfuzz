  \maketitle

\section*{Abstract}
This paper intents to summarize a quarter of undergraduate research in \emph{fuzzing}. In Section 1 we introduce fuzzing, methodologies, and best practices. Section 2 describes our experiences implementing those techniques on a real world library, the MPD project. Section 3 contains our closing thoughts, including words of advice for those interested.

\section{Introduction and Intent}
This project was intended to expand our understanding of fuzzing and how it applies to real world projects.
\section{Bug Hunting}

\section{Conclusion}
Fuzzing is easy if the codebase is terrible.
