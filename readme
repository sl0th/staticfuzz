MPD Protocol Fuzzer

1. Monitor
	The monitor's purpose is to watch over the target MPD server 
	and report any interesting signals sent to the target. These 
	signals may suggest a vulnerability in the server discovered 
	during the fuzzig process. 

	The monitor has the ability to communicate with a fuzzer. This
	is done over TCP and alerts the fuzzer that a vulnerability 
	may have been found.
